# RiverScript Backend

Short History. 
Back in 2006ish, I worked on an AIML chat client. Over the years it has evolved, going from VB6, to VB.Net, C#, Client side JS, Node JS and now in a RiveScript project using Go.
The conversion of NodeJS to GoLang was done using ChatGPT and a bit of manual work.
